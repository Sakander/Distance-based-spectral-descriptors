# Distance-based-spectral-descriptors
Here we explain how to compute a distance-based spectral topological descriptor.
Let G be a graph for which you would like to compute a distance-based spectral descriptors.

Step 1. Draw G on newGraph and check distance matrix as an invariant by going to "Invariants" tab to "Select Invariant".

Copy the distance matrix by right clicking on the matrix.

Step 2. Paste the matrix and order of G in the Distance_Spectral_Descriptors.m file in B and n resepctively.

Run the Distance_Spectral_Descriptors.m file to obtain your result.
